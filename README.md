# Anon Installation Script

## Description
This repository contains a script for installing the Anon Relay on a Debian-based Linux system. The script automates the process of adding the Anon repository, installing the Anon package, and configuring the Anon Relay with user-defined settings.

## Installation
To install the Anon Relay, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cl0ten/anon-install/refs/heads/main/install.sh)"
```

## Usage
Once installed, the Anon Relay can be configured with user-defined settings. Follow the prompts provided by the script to specify your desired nickname, contact information, bandwidth settings, ORPort, and MyFamily fingerprints.

## Example
This command installs the Anon Relay on your Debian-based Linux system. It prompts you to enter the desired nickname for the Anon Relay, contact information, comma-separated fingerprints for your relay's family (which can be skipped), BandwidthRate in Mbit (which can be skipped), BandwidthBurst in Mbit (which can be skipped), and ORPort. Here's an example of the output you might see:
